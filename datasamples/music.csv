11ari4r,BloatedBanana9,90s Bands That Are Still Making Good Music,"Recently Iâ€™ve been digging into the later discographies of bands that were big in the 90s then quietly fell off later (some more than others), but most of them have still been putting out great music this whole time - just not stuff that hits the radio.

Soul Asylum, The Verve Pipe, Candlebox, Fuel, and The Goo Goo Dolls have all released good albums within the last 5 years. What other bands that were big around that time have newer material thatâ€™s worth checking out?",34,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001BBB478EE20>

      "A balanced diet. You need a variety of foods (both plant-based and animal-based) to maintain optimal health and physical / cognitive performance. The 'healthiest diet' is one that excludes all damaging, unhealthy, inflammatory foods and at the same time includes lots of high-quality, properly-sourced, nutritious foods. Our body needs a specific quantity and ratio of nutrients to function properly and perform its metabolic functions. The vegan and carnivore diet are both dietary extremes. A nice diet that emphasizes nutrient density, digestibility, gut health, and at the same time excludes inflammatory, gut-irritating and immunogenic / immunostimulatory foods is the Paleo diet. Even more so, the autoimmune Paleo (AIP) diet. AIP is primarily targeted towards autoimmune patients who want to reverse / manage their autoimmune condition naturally. Both Paleo and autoimmune Paleo (AIP) are ancestral diets that emphasize nutrient density and minimize food-induced inflammation. Chronic inflammatory diseases are a modern pandemic and diet plays a huge role. Archaeological evidence shows that our ancestors didn’t develop the chronic inflammatory diseases we witness today in our modern world. And neither do modern-day hunter-gatherers. Just consider the following examples:   \n",
      "• The Tsimané people in Bolivia have an 80 percent lower rate of atherosclerosis than people in the United States.  \n",
      "• In Tanzania, less than 2 percent of Hadza adults are overweight (compared to nearly two-thirds of American adults), and diabetes is virtually non-existent.  \n",
      "• The Maasai in Kenya do not develop cardiovascular disease, despite a diet based on red meat, blood, and milk (so much for the theory that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease …).   \n",
      "What changed between then and now? Well, when we don’t live and eat in harmony with our physiology (and its limitations), a mismatch between our genes and the environment manifests that fuels the fire for chronic disease. Ancestral health and by extension an ancestral diet are the only solutions for this mismatch, from my experience. *The Simple AIP Handbοοk* by Geοrge Kelly is a nice read οn the tοpic.\n",
